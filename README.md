# SO_Events_Architecture
  (SO = Scriptable Object.)

Inspired by "Unite Austin 2017 - Game Architecture with Scriptable Objects"
  (for more information, see https://youtu.be/raQ3iHhE_Kk).

The video that helped me clarify how the above really works is "The Power of Scriptable Objects as Middle-Men"
  (for more information, see https://youtu.be/qUYpQ8ySkLU).

Compared to the code presented in "The Power of Scriptable Objects as Middle-Men", this version:
1. better encapsulates the health property inside HealthManagerSO, and
2. adds comments that helps clarify a few subtle points,
otherwise, it is pretty much identical to the version of the code presented in the video.
